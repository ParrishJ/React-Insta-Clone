In the article, “State Driven Development for User Interfaces (Part 1: An introduction)” by Nimmo, we are told about the benefits and pitfalls of using state driven development. On the one hand, one can inadvertently alter elements of an application when changing parts of a state driven application. On the other hand, using the components in a state driven application can allow one to look at the state of those components individually which makes testing, documentation, and other aspects of development easier. Overall, using state driven development is essential in application development today.
